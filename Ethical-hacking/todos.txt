						Ethical Hacking


# Hacker Type
-----------------------------------------

	White Hat Hackers
	--------------------------------
	White Hat hackers are also known as Ethical Hackers. They never 
	intent to harm a system, rather they try to find out weaknesses in a computer or a network system as a part of penetration 
	testing and vulnerability assessments.

	Ethical hacking is not illegal and it is one of the demanding 
	jobs available in the IT industry. There are numerous companies
	 that hire ethical hackers for penetration testing and vulnerability assessments.

	Black Hat Hackers
	--------------------------------
	Black Hat hackers, also known as crackers, are those who hack in
	order to gain unauthorized access to a system and harm its 
	operations or steal sensitive information.

	Black Hat hacking is always illegal because of its bad intent 
	which includes stealing corporate data, violating privacy, 
	damaging the system, blocking network communication, etc.

	Grey Hat Hackers
	--------------------------------
	Grey hat hackers are a blend of both black hat and white hat 
	hackers. They act without malicious intent but for their fun, 
	they exploit a security weakness in a computer system or network
	 without the owner’s permission or knowledge.

	Their intent is to bring the weakness to the attention of the 
	owners and getting appreciation or a little bounty from the 
	owners.

	Miscellaneous Hackers
	--------------------------------
	Apart from the above well-known classes of hackers, we have the 
	following categories of hackers based on what they hack and how 
	they do it −

	Red Hat Hackers
	--------------------------------
	Red hat hackers are again a blend of both black hat and white hat
	hackers. They are usually on the level of hacking government 
	agencies, top-secret information hubs, and generally anything 
	that falls under the category of sensitive information.

	Blue Hat Hackers
	--------------------------------
	A blue hat hacker is someone outside computer security 
	consulting firms who is used to bug-test a system prior to its 
	launch. They look for loopholes that can be exploited and try to
	close these gaps. Microsoft also uses the term BlueHat to 
	represent a series of security briefing events.

	Elite Hackers
	--------------------------------
	This is a social status among hackers, which is used to describe
	the most skilled. Newly discovered exploits will circulate among 
	these hackers.

	Script Kiddie
	--------------------------------
	A script kiddie is a non-expert who breaks into computer systems
	by using pre-packaged automated tools written by others, usually
	with little understanding of the underlying concept, hence the 
	term Kiddie.

	Neophyte
	--------------------------------
	A neophyte, "n00b", or "newbie" or "Green Hat Hacker" is someone 
	who is new to hacking or phreaking and has almost no knowledge 
	or experience of the workings of technology and hacking.

	Hacktivist
	--------------------------------
	A hacktivist is a hacker who utilizes technology to announce a
	social, ideological, religious, or political message. In 
	general, most hacktivism involves website defacement or 
	denialof-service attacks.
